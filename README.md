Hey there Professor Ortega and TA's!

Here is my Virtual Reality Haptic Glove: Assessing Dexterity of Users using a variety of input methods project

I am providing below the link to the repository I used to build the gloves where the wiki provides parts lists, the video build guide by the creator as well as the firmware for the ESP32 Microcontroller. Also Below I will provde the Hand Physics Lab Store Page as well as the Open Gloves configuration software for the gloves.

Due to the fact that my gloves were not working properly the day of the experiement I had the users wear the glove and answer the questionaire as well as practice grabbing object and trying to get a feel for how the glove might stack up against the other input methods. I will be dropping all of my supplies to run the experiemnt back off at the lab sometime this week as well as
