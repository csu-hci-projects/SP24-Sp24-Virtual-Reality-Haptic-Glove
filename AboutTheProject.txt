AboutTheProject.txt

This project explores the efficiency and user perceptions of two distinct Virtual Reality (VR) input methods: Hand Tracking and Controllers. 

Through a series of tasks, we measured the completion times and collected user feedback to assess comfort, accuracy, and intuitiveness of each method. 

Statistical analysis revealed that Controllers generally offer quicker task completion, while Hand Tracking is perceived as more intuitive and comfortable. 

The findings highlight important trade-offs between performance efficiency and user experience in VR systems. 

This study contributes to ongoing discussions in VR technology development, suggesting paths for future research on integrating user comfort with high performance
